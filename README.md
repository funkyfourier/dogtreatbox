# Box for dog treats with magnetic lid

Practical box intended for carrying dog treats with options for open and closed belt clip. The lid has embedded magnets for ease of use. Should be easily printed without supports, but requires pause during print to insert the magnets.

The box features two options for belt clips. One of them is a conventional open clip which slides on and off your belt easily:

The other clip attaches permanently to your belt, and is more suitable when doing various dog sports or other hefty physical activity:

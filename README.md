# Box for dog treats with magnetic lid

Practical box intended for carrying dog treats with options for open and closed belt clip. The lid has embedded magnets for ease of use. Should be easily printed without supports, but requires pause during print to insert the magnets.

The box features two options for belt clips. One of them is a conventional open clip which slides on and off your belt easily:

The other clip attaches permanently to your belt, and is more suitable when doing various dog sports or other hefty physical activity:

## How to print

None of the models require supports, so printing should be straight forward.

The closed/permanent belt clip should be printed laying down, with 100% infill like this:

The open belt clip should be printed on its side with generous brims, something like this:

## Inserting magnets

The magnets are embedded into the print by pausing the print job. This is supported by most modern printers and slicers.

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to use some adhesive when inserting the magnets. In my case, one of the magnets snapped on to the print head as it moved past it. This might or might not be an issue on your printer.

 You can probably use some thin double sided tape, but **make sure the magnets do not protrude beyond the layer height**. If they do they will crash with the nozzle. Recommended method is a tiny bit of super glue, and leave it for sufficient time to cure before resuming the print.

Pause the print before the first layer above the magnet compartment like this:

Similar for the lid:
